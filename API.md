# LCR Player API Endpoints

APIs for the LCR Player are split into the following sections:

- /api/public - used by the public frontend and other non-authenticated clients
- /api/private - used by the CMS, authenticated per user
- /api/utility - used by automated clients, using Token authentication

All requests expect/return JSON data unless stated otherwise

## Utility

Utility requests must be authenticated using a Bearer Token

Tokens can be obtained through the Dashboard

Please add the header `"Authorization" : "Bearer [key]"` with all requests

or use the URL parameter `token=[token]`

#### POST /api/utility/currentshow

Set the current show data that is displayed in the Player

```json
{
    "slug" : "show-slug",
    "title" : "Optional title",
    "description" : "Optional description",
    "image" : "optional url of 16:9 poster imag",
    "disableSongDisplay" : false
}
```

"disableSongDisplay" will hide the song list for the player if set to true.
If title & description are not set, the title and description for the specified show will be used.
All fields are optional. If a valid show slug is provided, data will be filled in from that show to replace blank values.

    "showSlug" : "slug-of-show-or-null",

#### POST /api/utility/episode/:id

Update an Episode entry. Request format is the same as for inserting a new episode. Note that all fields must be provided.

### Recorder Workflow

When the show starts:

 `POST /api/utility/currentshow` to update the player status

While the show is running:

`GET /api/utility/currentshow` occasionally to make sure the player status hasn't been overwritten
The response for this request will contain additional data for the show (if a valid slug is provided) and current song info

When the show ends:

1. `DELETE /api/utility/currentshow` to clear the current show data
2. Generate meta file & write to web file server
3. `POST /api/utility/episode` to add episode to database


## Private

Internal requests used by the CMS only
